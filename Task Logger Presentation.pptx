## Slide 4: Motivation
**Bullets:**  
- Time is valuable  
- Tasks are easy to forget  
- Need simple tracking  
**Speaker notes:** “As a maker and freelancer, I know how quickly the day disappears. Without tracking, it’s easy to underestimate work or forget where time went. I wanted a tool that was simple, lightweight, and accurate.”

## Slide 5: Preparation & Planning
**Flowchart:** Define features → Plan menu options → Write code in Python → Test & refine  
**Speaker notes:** “I first outlined the key features: start/stop tasks, summaries, and CSV logging. Then I designed a menu system, wrote the program in Python, and tested it with sample tasks.”

## Slide 6: Knowledge & Research
**Bullets:**  
- Knew: Python basics, file I/O  
- Learned: CSV handling, summaries, user menus  
**Speaker notes:** “I already knew basic Python, but I learned more about handling CSV files, formatting dates, and building user-friendly menus.”

**Speaker notes:** Walk through the program as a user: Run the program → see welcome screen. Start a task → enter customer, product, task. Press Enter when done → duration is saved. Show Summary → see minutes per customer. Delete Entry → remove a mistake. (Show this live or use pre-recorded screen capture.)

## Slide 8: Next Steps & Extensions
**Bullets:**  
- Add reports by week/month  
- Export to Excel/Google Sheets  
- Simple GUI version  
- Share via GitHub  
**Speaker notes:** “Next, I want to add longer reports, make an export option, and maybe a graphical interface. The code is on GitHub so others can use or contribute.”
